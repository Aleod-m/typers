# Numeric module.

At the moment the num only supports unsigned integers. I plan to add Signed Integers in the future.

Integers are represented as a list of bits with B0 representing a bit set to 0 and B1 a bit set to 1.

The `uint` macro is used to define usigned types from their bits with less verbosity. 

Uints from 0 to 32 have aliases.
